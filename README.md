# FlashCards
The purpose of this app is to make it easy to create flash cards for studying purposes. The project is currently planned to be made in Android Studio, which uses Java for the back-end language and has a built in GUI editor to get started. When you review flash cards, the app will keep track of ones you are less familiar with to review later. There are many opportunities in GUI development, practice with Google's Material design, functional programming, OOP for cards, database (sq-lite), and experience in a model-view-controller design pattern, singleton design pattern. If a person kept up on it, it would be a great way to study for finals, or as a quick reference in the future! Please refer to this project's Wiki for more details about the planning process, UML's, and screenshots.


### Kotlin Experience
This project is also set up so that you can learn/work with the Kotlin language. Kotlin can exist and execute alongside Java files. You can check out this [link](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/) and also this [link](https://medium.com/quick-code/top-tutorials-to-learn-kotlin-android-development-for-beginners-fad63af16996) for sites you can use to learn some Kotlin. *Please note that this repo has an early version of Kotlin, and it may need to be updated.*
