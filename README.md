# FlashCards
The purpose of this app is to make it easy to create flash cards for studying purposes. The project is currently planned to be made in Android Studio, which uses Java for the back-end language and has a built in GUI editor to get started. When you review flash cards, the app will keep track of ones you are less familiar with to review later. There are many opportunities in GUI development, functional programming, OOP for cards, database (sq-lite), and experience in a model-view-controller design pattern. If a person kept up on it, it would be a great way to study for finals, or as a quick reference in the future!
